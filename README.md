# Fusion 360 Scripts

The Gridfinity box maker was originally derived from https://github.com/benlaurie/gfdb/ but I drastically changed it to make it parameterized. I'm splitting it off because I added another thing (remote holster) and will likely add others.


## Utilities
- GridFinityDividerBoxMaker: configurable to make boxes for gridfinity
- RemoteHolsterMaker: configurable holster to hang a remote on a wall or side table

## Bugs

- There are a few fillets missing.
- No holes for screws.

None of these should be hard to fix - PRs welcome!
